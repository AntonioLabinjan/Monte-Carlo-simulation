# Monte-Carlo-simulation
Monte Carlo simulation using Python
In short, this code simulates the process of generating random points within a square and calculates how many of them fall within a quarter circle. Based on this ratio, the value of π is approximated, and the graphs help visualize the progression of the simulation and the estimation of π. The more points you generate, the more accurate your estimation of π will be.
